# MuseumMate Hardware

The MuseumMate project encompasses two distinct hardware versions, each leveraging different technologies to achieve precise localization within a museum environment.

## Directory Structure

- `/BLE` - Contains files related to the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) version.
- `/UWB` - Contains files related to the UWB (Ultra-Wideband) version.

Each directory contains source code and documentation specific to the firmware development for the ESP32 microcontroller, tailored to the respective technology.

## BLE Version

The BLE version represents the initial approach to hardware development in the MuseumMate project. Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy technology for location tracking, this version was developed and refined throughout the Fall 2023 semester. It serves as the first implementation, focusing on proving the basic concept and functionality of the system.

## UWB Version

In response to the limitations observed with BLE in precise localization, the UWB version was developed as a significant upgrade. Using Ultra-Wideband technology, this version offers greatly enhanced accuracy in localization. The development of this hardware iteration occurred during the Spring 2024 semester, marking a major milestone in the projectâ€™s evolution.
